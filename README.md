# Segmentation of the UK Labour Market: Replicating Results

These codes replicate results from **Martin and Okolo (2023): "Segmentation of the UK Labour Market"**. The codes are written in _Matlab_ and _Stata_. 

1. The resuts in Table 1), columns (i) and (ii) of Table 2) and Table 5) are generated by running "run_uk_clustering_basline.m" in Matlab, folowed by "gen_results_baseline.do" in Stata.

2. Clustering is done in "cluster_2_8", which is called from "gen_results_baseline.do".

3. Figure 1) is generated in "sil_stats", which is called from "gen_results_baseline.do". Silhouette statistcs by decile are generated by "sil_stats_by_decile_uk"
 
4. Column (iii) of Table 2) is generated using "gamma_stats"

5. Columns (iv)-(v) of Table 2)are generated on lines 32-33 of "gen_results_baseline.do".

6. Table 3) is generated by "omega_stats"

7. The results in columns (i)-(ii) of Table 4) are generated by running "run_uk_clustering_alt_1.m", folowed by "gen_results_alt_1.do". The results in columns (iii)-(iv) of Table 4) are generated by running "run_uk_clustering_alt_2m.m", folowed by "gen_results_alt_2.do".

8. The results obtained using k-means and fuzzy c-means alogorithms, reported in section 5.2) are geneated using "alt-algo.m".
